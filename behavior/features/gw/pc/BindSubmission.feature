Feature: New Submission to Bind
    As a user I want to perform Bind Policy transaction in policy center

    @bind_submission
    Scenario: Creating personal auto bind
        Given the user logs into the policy center as superuser
        When the user loads the data "defaultDataSet" from json "NewSubmissionTestData"
        And the user creates personal account
        And the user bind the new submission
        Then the bind policy should be successful
