Feature: New Submission to Quote
        As a user I want to perform Quote Policy transaction in policy center

        @quote_submission
        Scenario: Creating personal auto quote
                Given the user logs into the policy center as superuser
                When the user loads the data "defaultDataSet" from json "NewSubmissionTestData"
                And the user creates personal account
                And the user quote the new submission
                Then the quote policy should be successful
